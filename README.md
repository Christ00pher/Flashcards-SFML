Hello people! I started to work on my new project 'Flashcards' written in C++ using SFML!

Here's a first look at the main menu:

(Third button is in the background color 'cause I'm playing with transparent background in textures ;)

Oh... such a beauty! More screens come with new features.


Here's new Flashcards app look - now app is able to close after clicking on the exit button! Oh yeah!
